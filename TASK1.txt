Steps to achieve triggering Jenkin Jobs Using Github Webhooks:



1.) First Create a github repository and push some sample code into it.
    After that Copy that github Url 
2.) Open jenkins and create first job ->Enter that job name and save it.
     After open source code management and choose git 
          Repository name :paste git url
          Credentials:
3.) In Jenkins->Build triggers->Select Github hook trigger for GITScm pulling ( becoz this job listens the the webhook
 triggers from github)

Now open repository -> Settings->Webhooks->Add Webhook->Payload Url:----------
->Content Type:->Add Webhook
